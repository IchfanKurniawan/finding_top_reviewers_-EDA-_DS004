Finding the top reviewers from the steam game platform

### Problem Statement
To make the community in the steam game platform more active, reviews from earlier access user are useful for others to give an early descriptions & experiences about the game and also for game developers it will be essential to fix & develop a better game performances. So, we should give the top reviewers incentives (e.g. early access, voucher, etc) ... and in the future it could be beneficial for the steam game platform.

### Needs
- We need to find who are the top reviewers.
- Take a look at the distribution of the top reviewers attributes.

### Data Exploration
The data exploration you could check in the notebook above. I used plotly for visualization of some data because it is quite handy and also interactive.
